Coursera Practical Machine Learning Project

This project was performed for the Practical Machine Laarning Course offered by Johns Hopkins.

The data files and R markdown (.Rmd) file need to be in the same working directory before the Rmd file is run.

The analysis methodology used is slow. The script will take 1 hour or more to run.

Cheers.
