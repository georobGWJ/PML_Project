### Load the Libraries and Data
```{r}
library(caret, randomForest)

test <- read.csv("pml-testing.csv")
train <- read.csv("pml-training.csv")

# Change the classifications into factors
train$classe <- as.factor(train$classe)
```
### Create Basic Models
```{r}
modGLM <- train(classe ~., method="glm", data=train)
modRF <- train(classe ~., method="rf", data=train)
```
You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r, echo=FALSE}
#plot(cars)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
